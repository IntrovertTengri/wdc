'wdc' is a library specifically crafted to simplify interactions with coverage datasets, which are commonly used in geospatial data processing and analysis. 'wdc' serves as a bridge between users and web coverage processing service queries (WCPS), making it easier to access and work with geospatial coverage datasets, enabling users to effectively analyze and manipulate the data they retrieve.

We implemented this library in Python that handles various aspects of data querying. We have tested 70% of the program with the Pytest framework. We have written a comprehensive guide to the library. We have written comprehensive documentation for the library. We have created class diagrams and activity diagrams in UML. We have provided detailed comments to the code.
